🚕 Ride Prediction Analysis using Snowflake

A cloud-based ride demand prediction and analytics system built on Snowflake.
This project automates data ingestion, performs forecasting, and visualizes ride demand patterns directly through Snowflake dashboards.

🚀 Project Overview

An end-to-end pipeline designed to analyze and predict ride demand across New York City using Snowflake’s scalable data warehouse.
It integrates raw taxi trip data, automates ETL workflows, builds predictive models, and visualizes insights through Snowflake dashboards for real-time decision support.
